My name is Brian Lockerbie. I am a recent Full Stack JavaScript Developer graduate from Treehouse. I am an enthusiastic , outgoing and assertive solution seeker who is excited to be at the development phase of my new career. I am ambitious, driven and meticulous, as well as hard working and able to quickly learn new skills. I have been working in web development since 2019, and my repertoire includes programming languages and tools such as ReactJS, jQuery, Bootstrap and more. I am always pursuing ways to create, discover and experience new technology. I am self motivated and a self taught professional who likes to solve problems.
