		<p>My name is Brian Lockerbie. I am a recent Full Stack JavaScript Developer graduate from Treehouse. 
	    Enthusiastic, outgoing, assertive solution seeker. Excited to be at the deployment phase of my new career
	    as a web developer. I am ambitious, driven and a meticulous hard worker & faster learner. I have been working
	    with web development since 2019. I am self motivated and a self taught professional who likes to solve problems. 
	    My repertoire includes programming languages and tools such as ReactJS, MySQL, jQuery, Bootstrap and more. 
		I am always pursuing to learn more, create and experience new technology.</p>
		<p><strong>I am versed in:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			    <li>HTML</li>
			    <li>CSS</li>
			    <li>JavaScript (+ JQuery)</li>
			    <li>Development Tools (Command Line, Git & Github)</li>
			    <li>Python</li>

		</ul>

	    <p>I know how important and what major difference it makes taking the time to learn and apply a new language even
	    over the weekend. I am passionate about Mobile Web Design and providing an engaging user experience on all platforms.
	    Continual education and keeping up with the latest technology trends are both very important to me.I look forward
	    to applying my previous work experience in business to a new career in tech. Click here to view my Treehouse profile
