This project uses Object-Oriented JavaScript to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard. Guess what letters are within the phrase by clicking on that key. If the letter is in the phrase it'll show on the template. If you guess incorrectly, you lose a life. Lose all your lives and you lose. If you guess all the letters correctly you win the game.

Techniques and Concepts -
Object-Oriented Programming
JavaScript classes
