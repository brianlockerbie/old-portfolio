Fourth project for the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree. A phrase hunter game similar to the popular game 'hangman'. Guess what letters are within the phrase by clicking on that key. If the letter is in the phrase it'll show on the template. If you guess incorrectly, you lose a life. Lose all your lives and you lose. If you guess a the letters correctly you win the game. Uses object-oriented programming and DOM manipulation.
