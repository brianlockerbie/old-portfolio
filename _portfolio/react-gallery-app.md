In this project I created A React app that creates an image gallery. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. JSX is used to write markup-like syntax directly in the JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.

Techniques and Concepts: Create-React-App, JSX, React Router, Fetch API & Flickr API
