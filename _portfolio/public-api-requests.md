I built an application for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. This application makes an AJAX call to a Random User Generator and displays the response on the page. When the image or name is clicked, a modal window is clicked with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

Techniques and concepts
AJAX (Fetch request)
Third-party API
JSON objects
Array iteration methods
