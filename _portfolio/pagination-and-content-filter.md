I created a single-paged app that displays a list of users that are hard coded into the HTML. Without JavaScript, this page displays a long list of students. I have enhanced the usability of the page by using unobtrusive JavaScript to dynamically divide the list into "pages". Each 'page' now only displays 10 students at a time. When the links at the bottom are clicked, the corresponding page is displayed. Also alows the user to filter through names with a search bar.
