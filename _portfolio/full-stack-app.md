description: This is the tenth of ten projects for the üè° Treehouse TechDegree Full Stack JavaScript. 
---
I created a full stack application with a back-end using Node.js, Express, SQL and Sequelize, and a front-end of React.js. This application will allow you to create a user account, login with authentication and create, edit and delete and view courses. You must create an account to create a course and must be authorized to update and delete any course.

Techniques and Concepts: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize ORM, Express Validator, React, REST API, User Authorization % Error Handling
